In this SQL code, I'm using SQL to sift through data from Spotify's top 50 songs of 2021.

#1. What is the most used song key within the top 50? How many songs in the top 50 used this key?
SELECT song_key, 
count(track_name)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP By song_key
ORDER By count(track_name) desc
LIMIT 1
;

#2. Which artists had the multiple top 50 hits in 2021?
SELECT artist_name, 
count(track_name)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP By artist_name
HAVING count(track_name) > 1
ORDER By count(track_name) desc
;

#3. What were the 10 most popular songs of 2021?
SELECT track_name, 
artist_name, 
popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10
;

#4. Which song keys have the highest average popularity how many songs of each song key were there?
SELECT song_key, 
AVG(popularity),
COUNT(song_key)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP By song_key
ORDER By AVG(popularity) desc
;

#5. Which song had the highest danceability among the top 50?
SELECT track_name
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER By danceability desc
LIMIT 1
;

#6. Which song was the longest? How popular was it?

track_name,
AVG(duration_ms) as song_length,
popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP By track_name
ORDER By AVG(duration_ms) desc
LIMIT 1
;
